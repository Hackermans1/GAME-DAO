# A GAMING DAO: THE TRUE FORM FOR BUILDING COMMUNITY

Project was implemented for *Hack It Sapiens HACKATHON*

## Inspiration

The best way to grow a community is to engage with it.DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, are decentralized organizations that operate based on pre-programmed rules encoded on a blockchain. DAOs have the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry by providing a transparent and secure way to manage in-game assets, enable community-driven decision-making, and ensure fairness in gameplay. <br>

* Managing in-game assets: DAOs can be used to manage in-game assets such as virtual currencies , to stop the reliance on DLCs 
* Community-driven decision-making: DAOs can enable community-driven decision-making in games. For example, players can vote on new game features, in-game events, and even changes to the game's rules.

* Enabling player-owned economies: DAOs can enable player-owned economies, where players can buy, sell, and trade in-game assets with each other.

## What it does and Its Potential:

The tokenomics makes this project standout as it's ability to be in the lines of *Gaming Ecosystem*, *Corparation entity* , *Devlopers* and the main *Players* and still be preffered by all the sides.Gaming DAOs function as gaming platforms based on open-source codes and are not affiliated with any gaming administrator or operators. Gaming DAOs are communitarian at the core and focus on creating a player-driven gaming ecosystem. 

Gaming DAOs have the power to redistribute the ownership of a game in an entire community of various gaming ecosystems. This redistribution occurs among players, game developers, investors and traders.
The major revenue for DAOs are recieved by play-to-earn in Web3 gaming. They are revolutionary gaming concepts that compensate players for their gaming participation and success in a game.

It has 2 major part in the Tokenomics aspect as it gives its GameDevlopers to reap their benefit of their loyalties as it will allow them to enjoy staking rewards along with divedends as well that they are liable to.

While the normal player will not be able to get divedends , but is able to push for governance and proposals for in game and even maybe physcical experiences. this  involves the ability to express intrest in other polls as well and *bond* on it as well.

## IMPLEMENTATION OF TOKEN GAITING:
 Which uses Pinata and leverages *IPFS* , to verify whereby communities can provide exclusive access to spaces, events, content, and communities to people who own specific digital assets in their wallet i.e NFTS.

Apart from increasing exclusivity it also increases inclusivity between token holders, and allows project creators to grant access to content, events, and merch exclusively to token holders. 

Token gating allows token holders to access special rewards. This acts as an honour for Game Devlopers and harbours trust in the community.

## USING HYPERLANE FUNCTIONALITY:
Hyperlane connects your applications across many blockchains. This allows users to interact with your application from the chain they're on. Reducing the amount of hoops they have to jump through just to get to your app. It's about abstracting away the complexity of navigating between chains, and letting you and your users simply focus on your app.
